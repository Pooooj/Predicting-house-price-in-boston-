Problem Overview:
The goal is to predict housing prices in Boston suburbs based on various features of the locality. This is a supervised learning problem, where we have both input features (independent variables) and a target variable (dependent variable - the housing price).

Attribute Information (in order):

CRIM: per capita crime rate by town

ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft.

INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town

CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)

NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)

RM: average number of rooms per dwelling

AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940

DIS: weighted distances to five Boston employment centers

RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways

TAX: full-value property-tax rate per 10,000 dollars

PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town

LSTAT: %lower status of the population

MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in 1000 dollars.

Key Components:
a. Data Preprocessing:

Splitting the data into dependent (MEDV) and independent variables (all other features)
Creating dummy variables for categorical features (like CHAS)
Adding a constant term to the independent variables (for the intercept in linear regression)
Splitting the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets

b. Model Building:

Using linear regression to create a predictive model

c. Feature Importance:

Identifying which features have the most significant impact on housing prices


The Two Variables You Asked About:
a. LSTAT: % lower status of the population

This variable represents the percentage of the population considered to be of "lower status"
It's a socioeconomic indicator that might reflect factors like education level, income, or occupation
A higher value might indicate a less affluent area, which could potentially correlate with lower housing prices

b. MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s

This is the target variable we're trying to predict
It represents the median value of owner-occupied homes in the area
The values are in thousands of dollars (e.g., a value of 21.0 would mean $21,000)


Importance of These Variables:

LSTAT is likely to be an important predictor. Areas with a higher percentage of lower status population might have lower housing prices.
MEDV is crucial as it's what we're trying to predict. Understanding its distribution and relationship with other variables will be key to building an accurate model.


Approach:

After preprocessing, you'll use linear regression to model the relationship between the features and MEDV
The model will learn coefficients for each feature, indicating their importance in predicting house prices
You can then analyze these coefficients to understand which features have the strongest influence on housing prices

**Final Model Inferences**

Relationship Between Variables and House Prices

Positive Relationships:
Higher ZN (zoned land) is associated with higher house prices.
Higher RM (average number of rooms) is associated with higher house prices.
Higher RAD (accessibility to radial highways) is associated with higher house prices.
Being bounded by the Charles River (CHAS_Yes) is associated with higher house prices.

Negative Relationships:
Higher CRIM (crime rate) is associated with lower house prices.
Higher NX (number of rooms) is associated with lower house prices.
Higher DIS (distance to employment centers) is associated with lower house prices.
Higher PTRATIO (pupil-teacher ratio) is associated with lower house prices.
Higher LSTAT (percentage of lower-status population) is associated with lower house prices.

Model Fit
R-squared: While the R-squared of 0.703 is relatively high, it indicates that only 70.3% of the variation in house prices is explained by the model. This suggests that there might be other factors influencing house prices that are not included in the model.

Model Assumptions
Normality of Residuals: The diagnostic tests (Omnibus, Skew, Kurtosis, Jarque-Bera) indicate that the residuals are not normally distributed. This violates one of the key assumptions of linear regression. Non-normality of residuals can affect the validity of the statistical inferences.

Overall, the model provides valuable insights into the factors influencing house prices.
